# CPET-133

This is where I am storing the labs that are for my Introduction to Digital and Micro Systems class, taken in Spring of 2022. 

The code we are required to write for these labs is in C, written using CCS (Code Composer Studio), and runs on the TI MSP430 microcontroller.
The labs that are not here were all done in a program called Quartus II.
